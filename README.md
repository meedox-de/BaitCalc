</p>

A simple Yii 2 based bait calculator app I developed for a friend. 
It can manage and calculate bait recipes. 
There is also a simple user management. 
The app is written in PHP and uses the Yii 2 framework.
A translation is implemented and works in English and German.
The app can be run as a web app.

Codeception tests doesnÂ´t exist yet. The app is very simple and the tests are not necessary at the moment.
